# FAVOURITE THINGS HOMEWORK

Favorite things to eat

## Description

This is a one-page app, which shows three of my favorite food, some nutrition information about it, vitamin composition and taste. This app is built with adding a dynamic information on it which is retrieved from the database.

## Functionality

This is a dynamic app that has a responsive design for different kinds of screens: mobile, tablet and desktop. It has an SQL database and almost all information retrieving from the database into "hbs" file. Each piece of food has a lightbox with dynamic data, which is appeared by clicking on the "Read more" button.
